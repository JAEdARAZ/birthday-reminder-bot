## Deploy
Deploy stack with the following command: 
`sls deploy --param="telegramBotSecret=INSERT_SECRET"`

## Possible new features
- Search birthdays by month / send message every 1st of month with the birthdays (GSI).
- What if I don't know the year of birth? It is actually not necessary for calculating the TTL. If present, the notification of birthday could tell the age.
